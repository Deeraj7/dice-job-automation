## Introduction

The **Dice Job Application Automation** tool is designed to make the job application process on Dice.com more efficient and less time-consuming.

       "username": "your_email@example.com",
       "password": "your_password"

   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Update `config.py` with your Dice.com credentials and search preferences.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

In `config.py`, you can customize:
- **Login Credentials**: Username and password for Dice.com.
- **Search Keywords**: The keyword(s) to search for relevant job postings.
- **Max Applications**: Maximum number of applications per run.
- **Resume Path**: Specify the path to your resume file, which will be used in applications.
- **Other Search Filters**: You can add filters based on other criteria to further refine job search.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

1. **Login Issues**
   - Double-check your credentials in `config.py`.
   - Ensure your ChromeDriver version matches your installed Chrome browser version.

2. **Application Process Stalls**
   - If the bot fails to click "Easy Apply," ensure that the jobs being targeted have the Easy Apply option.

3. **Shadow DOM Errors**
   - Ensure the `shadow_dom_handler.py` script is functioning correctly. Some web elements on Dice might require specific handling.

4. **Rate Limiting on Dice**
   - Dice.com might limit requests if too many actions are performed quickly. The script includes delays to mimic human behavior, but further customization may be needed.
